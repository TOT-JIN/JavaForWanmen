Spring Web Flow provides a declarative flow definition language for authoring flows on a higher level of abstraction. 

* Visualizing the flow is very difficult.
* The application has a lot of code accessing the HTTP session.
* Enforcing controlled navigation is important but not possible.
* Proper browser back button support seems unattainable.
* Browser and server get out of sync with "Back" button use.
* Multiple browser tabs causes concurrency issues with HTTP session data.
